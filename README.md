## Description
Summary: Remembering numerous passwords from various different sites can be difficult for a user. So to provide some flexibility we can provide users a graphical password authentication system where instead of creating a password a user has to select graphical objects in a particular order to keep it as their password.


Objective: In this method, the user is required to select one image category (letâ€™s say one of the category like cat) and it will display 16 types of that category images(10 types of cat images),now the user can select any 1 type of image and then the image is separated into grids(Select any 2 grids). Next time the user tries to log in, the user should the same category image and select those type of image and also the grids , but the user will be required to follow the same pattern which was used initially. If the user forgotten the pattern/password,then the otp has been sent into the registered email and can update the password. This type of authentication is difficult to break since neither brute force nor dictionary attacks could breach it. We need techniques that can be easily implemented and provide better results to this process.


  Graphical Password with multiple rounds of security.
  
  Combination of Recognition based and Cue Based Graphical Password.
  
  Competitive strength to alphanumeric passwords with additional advantages like No Dictionary attacks, difficult brute force 
  attacks, etc.
